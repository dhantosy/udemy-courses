React is a library to create ui components

*why react?*
- UI state is dificult to handle in vanilla js
- good community and ecosystem

*react alternatives*
great at creating powerful application and focus on the logic
- angular
- vue

*SPA/Multiple page application*
- SPA
-- Only one html page, content is rendered on client
-- entire page consists of components handled by js


- Multiple
-- multi html pages
-- content is rendered on server
-- can consists of react component

**ES6 & next gen JS**
*let & const*
- use let to create variables.
- use const to create a constant value, which assign only once and never change.

*arrow functions*
- no more issues with 'this' keyword in js
- 'this' in arrow function will always keep its context and not change it

*exports & imports (modules)*
- default export
- named export

*classes*
- more convenient way to create constructor function
- can consist of property, and method
- supports inheritance using extends
- properties are like variable atached to class/object
- method are like function attached to class/object

*spread and rest operators*
- spread is used to split array elements or object properties
- rest is used to merge a list of function args into an array

*destructuring*
- easily extract array elements or object properties and store in variables
